Para 1-2: Engine Cranks But Won't Start
Symptom: Engine turns over but fails to fire
Probable Causes (in order of likelihood):
1. Fuel System Issue (65% probability)
Empty or contaminated fuel tank
Clogged fuel filter (service life: 15,000 miles)
Faulty fuel pump (test pressure: 40-50 PSI)
2. Ignition System Issue (30% probability)
Spark plug failure (gap spec: 0.040")

Step 2: Test fuel pressure
Connect pressure gauge to fuel rail test port
Key to ON position (do not crank)

These indicate fuel mixture or catalyst issues [Citation: Para 5-2.2]
Step 3: Inspect air filter
Remove filter from housing
Hold up to light source
Should see light through filter media
If blocked or heavily contaminated, replace [Citation: Para 5-2.3, Figure 5-1]

SECTION 6: DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODES
Para 6-1: OBD-II Code Overview
On-Board Diagnostics II (OBD-II) system monitors emissions and powertrain. When fault detected, system
stores code and may illuminate check engine light.
Code Format: P0XXX (Powertrain) or P1XXX (Manufacturer Specific)
Para 6-2: Code P0420 - Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold
Description: Catalytic converter not operating at required efficiency
Possible Causes:
1. Catalytic converter degradation (most common)
2. Oxygen sensor failure (upstream or downstream)
3. Exhaust leak before catalyst
4. Engine running too rich (other codes present)
Diagnostic Steps:
Step 1: Verify code is current
Clear codes with scan tool
Drive vehicle through complete drive cycle
If code returns, proceed with diagnosis [Citation: Para 6-2.1]
Step 2: Check oxygen sensor operation
Monitor O2 sensor voltages with scan tool
Upstream sensor: should fluctuate 0.1-0.9V rapidly

--- PAGE 19 ---
Downstream sensor: should be steady around 0.45V
If downstream sensor fluctuates like upstream, converter failed [Citation: Para 6-2.2, Figure 6-1]
Step 3: Inspect for exhaust leaks
Check all connections before catalyst
Leak causes false air reading, triggers code
Listen for hissing sound with engine running [Citation: Para 6-2.3]
Repair: If converter confirmed failed, replacement required. Typical cost: $400-1200 including labor. Use
OEM or quality aftermarket converter meeting EPA standards. [Citation: Para 6-2.4]
Para 6-3: Code P0171 - System Too Lean (Bank 1)
Description: Engine running with insufficient fuel or excessive air
Possible Causes:
1. Vacuum leak (intake manifold, brake booster hose)
2. Mass airflow sensor contamination
3. Weak fuel pump or clogged filter
4. Faulty oxygen sensor
5. Exhaust leak before O2 sensor
Diagnostic Steps:
Step 1: Check for vacuum leaks
Listen for hissing sound at idle
Spray carburetor cleaner around intake gaskets
If idle changes when spraying, leak found at that location [Citation: Para 6-3.1]
⚠  CAUTION: Carburetor cleaner is flammable. Keep away from ignition sources. Work in ventilated area.
[Safety Notice 6-A]
Step 2: Inspect MAF sensor
Remove sensor from air intake tube
Examine sensing element for oil or dirt

--- PAGE 20 ---
Clean with MAF sensor cleaner only (do not use other solvents)
Allow to dry completely before reinstalling [Citation: Para 6-3.2]
Step 3: Test fuel pressure
Connect gauge to test port
Should read 40-50 PSI with key ON, engine OFF
Pressure below 40 PSI indicates pump or filter problem
See Para 5-3.1 for fuel system testing [Citation: Para 6-3.3]
Para 6-4: Code P0301-P0304 - Cylinder Misfire
Description: Combustion misfire detected in specific cylinder
Possible Causes (for affected cylinder):
1. Spark plug fouled or worn (check gap: should be 0.040")
2. Ignition coil failure (coil-on-plug design)
3. Fuel injector clogged or failed
4. Low compression (valve or piston ring issue)
5. Vacuum leak at that cylinder
Diagnostic Steps:
Step 1: Swap spark plug and coil
Move spark plug from misfiring cylinder to another
Move ignition coil from misfiring cylinder to another
Clear code and drive
If misfire moves to new cylinder: plug or coil is bad
If misfire stays at same cylinder: mechanical issue [Citation: Para 6-4.1]
Step 2: Test compression
Remove all spark plugs
Disable fuel and ignition

--- PAGE 21 ---
Thread compression tester into misfiring cylinder
Crank engine and record pressure
Should be 140-170 PSI
Below 100 PSI indicates mechanical failure [Citation: Para 6-4.2, Table 6-1]
Step 3: Check fuel injector
Use scan tool to compare injector pulse widths
Misfiring cylinder may show different pulse
Test injector resistance: should be 12-16 ohms
Low or high resistance indicates failed injector [Citation: Para 6-4.3]

System Normal Range Action Required
O2 Sensor (upstream) 0.1-0.9V fluctuating Replace if stuck or slow
O2 Sensor (downstream) 0.45V steady Replace if fluctuating
