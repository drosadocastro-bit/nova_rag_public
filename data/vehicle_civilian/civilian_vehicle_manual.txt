### SECTION 2: ROUTINE MAINTENANCE

**Engine Oil Change**

The engine oil and oil filter should be changed according to the maintenance schedule. For normal driving conditions, change every 7,500 miles or 12 months, whichever comes first.

**Required Materials:**
- Engine oil: 5W-30 synthetic blend, 4.5 quarts
- Oil filter: Part number OF-2024-STD
- Oil drain plug washer (replace each change)
- Oil filter wrench
- Drain pan (minimum 5 quart capacity)

**Procedure:**
1. Warm the engine to operating temperature (about 5 minutes of driving)
2. Park on level ground and engage parking brake
3. Turn off engine and wait 5 minutes for oil to drain to pan
4. Locate oil drain plug under vehicle (front center of oil pan)
5. Place drain pan under plug
6. Remove drain plug using 14mm socket wrench
7. Allow oil to drain completely (approximately 10 minutes)
8. Replace drain plug washer and reinstall plug (torque: 29 lb-ft)
9. Locate oil filter on passenger side of engine
10. Remove old filter using filter wrench (turn counterclockwise)
11. Apply thin layer of new oil to new filter's rubber gasket
12. Install new filter by hand until gasket contacts, then tighten 3/4 turn
13. Add 4 quarts of new oil through filler cap
14. Start engine and let idle for 2 minutes
15. Check for leaks around drain plug and filter
16. Turn off engine, wait 5 minutes, check oil level
17. Add remaining oil to bring level to "FULL" mark
18. Reset maintenance reminder in vehicle computer

**Air Filter Replacement**

Replace engine air filter every 30,000 miles or when visibly dirty.

**Procedure:**
1. Open hood and locate air filter housing (black plastic box on driver's side)
2. Release four clips securing housing cover
3. Lift cover and remove old filter element
4. Inspect housing for debris and clean if necessary
5. Install new filter with pleated side facing down
6. Ensure filter seats properly in housing grooves
7. Replace cover and secure all four clips
8. Verify cover is fully seated

**Tire Rotation & Pressure Check**

Rotate tires every 7,500 miles to ensure even wear. Check tire pressure monthly and before long trips.

**Rotation Pattern (Front-Wheel Drive):**
- Front left → Rear right
- Front right → Rear left  
- Rear left → Front left
- Rear right → Front right

**Checking Tire Pressure:**
1. Check when tires are cold (driven less than 1 mile)
2. Remove valve cap
3. Press tire gauge firmly onto valve stem
4. Read pressure and compare to specification (door jamb sticker)
5. Add or release air as needed
6. Replace valve cap

**Brake Fluid Check**

Check brake fluid level monthly. Fluid should be between MIN and MAX marks on reservoir.

**Procedure:**
1. Locate brake fluid reservoir (driver's side of engine bay, near firewall)
2. Clean area around cap to prevent contamination
3. Check fluid level without removing cap (reservoir is translucent)
4. If low, remove cap and add DOT 4 brake fluid to MAX line
5. Do not overfill
6. Replace cap securely
7. If fluid is consistently low, have brake system inspected immediately

**Battery Maintenance**

Check battery terminals every 6 months for corrosion. Clean if necessary.

**Cleaning Procedure:**
1. Turn off engine and remove key
2. Disconnect negative (-) terminal first using 10mm wrench
3. Disconnect positive (+) terminal
4. Mix baking soda and water (1 tablespoon per cup)
5. Apply solution to terminals and cable ends with brush
6. Rinse with clean water
7. Dry thoroughly
8. Apply thin layer of petroleum jelly to prevent corrosion
9. Reconnect positive (+) terminal first, then negative (-)
10. Tighten terminals securely (torque: 11 lb-ft)

### SECTION 3: COMMON TROUBLESHOOTING

**Engine Won't Start**

If engine won't start, check the following:

1. **Battery Dead:**
   - Symptoms: No lights, no sounds when turning key
   - Solution: Jump start or replace battery
   - Jump start procedure:
     * Connect red cable to dead battery positive (+)
     * Connect other red cable end to good battery positive (+)
     * Connect black cable to good battery negative (-)
     * Connect other black cable to unpainted metal on dead car (not battery)
     * Start good car, let run 2 minutes
     * Try starting dead car
     * Remove cables in reverse order

2. **Fuel System Issues:**
   - Symptoms: Engine cranks but won't start, fuel gauge shows empty
   - Check: Fuel level, fuel pump fuse (15A in under-hood fuse box, position 23)
   - Listen for fuel pump hum when key turned to ON (before START)

3. **Starter Motor Failure:**
   - Symptoms: Click sound but engine doesn't turn
   - Check: Battery voltage (should be 12.4V or higher)
   - Have starter tested at auto parts store

4. **Security System Lockout:**
   - Symptoms: Security light flashing, engine cranks but won't start
   - Solution: Try second key fob, wait 10 minutes with key in ON position
   - If persists, tow to dealer for key programming

**Check Engine Light**

When check engine light illuminates:
1. Check gas cap - tighten until it clicks 3 times
2. Drive normally for 3 days to see if light resets
3. If light flashes, stop driving immediately (indicates misfire)
4. Have diagnostic codes read at parts store or dealer
5. Common codes:
   - P0420: Catalytic converter efficiency below threshold
   - P0171: System too lean (vacuum leak or MAF sensor)
   - P0301-P0304: Cylinder misfire (spark plugs or coils)

**Brake Warning Light**

If brake warning light stays on:
1. Check parking brake - ensure fully released
2. Check brake fluid level - add DOT 4 if low
3. If light stays on with parking brake released and fluid full:
   - DO NOT DRIVE
   - Have vehicle towed to repair facility
   - May indicate brake system failure

**Tire Pressure Warning**

When tire pressure light illuminates:
1. Stop safely and check all tire pressures
2. Inflate to specification on door jamb sticker
3. Drive at 50+ mph for 10 minutes to reset sensor
4. If light stays on, one or more sensors may need replacement

**Overheating Engine**

If temperature gauge enters red zone or steam appears:
1. Pull over safely and turn off engine immediately
2. DO NOT open radiator cap when hot
3. Wait 30 minutes for engine to cool
4. Check coolant level in overflow reservoir
5. If low, add 50/50 coolant mix to cold fill line
6. Check for visible leaks under vehicle
7. If coolant full and no leaks, have cooling system inspected

**Poor Fuel Economy**

If fuel economy decreases significantly:
1. Check tire pressure - under-inflated tires reduce efficiency
2. Replace air filter if dirty
3. Check driving habits - aggressive acceleration reduces MPG
4. Remove excess weight from vehicle
5. Use cruise control on highway
6. Ensure AC is not running when not needed
7. Have fuel system cleaned if over 50,000 miles

### SECTION 4: SEASONAL MAINTENANCE

**Winter Preparation**

Before winter driving:
1. Install winter tires or all-season tires with adequate tread (4/32" minimum)
2. Check battery - cold reduces capacity by 30-50%
3. Fill washer fluid with winter formula (rated to -20°F minimum)
4. Check wiper blades - replace if streaking
5. Test heater and defroster operation
6. Keep emergency kit: blanket, flashlight, ice scraper, sand/salt
7. Keep fuel tank at least half full to prevent fuel line freeze

**Summer Preparation**

Before summer driving:
1. Check AC system operation - should blow cold (40°F or less)
2. Inspect coolant level and condition
3. Check coolant concentration (should be 50/50 mix for -34°F to 265°F protection)
4. Test cooling fan operation (runs when AC on or engine hot)
5. Check tire pressure (increases in heat - adjust accordingly)
6. Replace cabin air filter if musty smell present
