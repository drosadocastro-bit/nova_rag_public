<h1>Troubleshooting Overview</h1><b><a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Pump/">FUEL PUMP</a> TROUBLESHOOTING</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The fuel supply system is an integral part of the operation of the fuel injection system. Problems such as a no-start condition, hesitation or stalling may be due to poor fuel delivery. There are some preliminary tests to quickly determine if the fuel pump or its electrical circuit are causing the problem. Some of the tests require special test equipment, such as a <a href="460.html">fuel pressure</a> gauge.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The electrical current that operates the <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Pump/">fuel pump</a> is controlled by a relay and protected by a 20-amp fuse. This helps to handle the high current load of the pump and also ensures that the pump will not continue to run in the event of an accident or if the engine stalls. If, for any reason, electric power to run the pump is interrupted, the engine will not run.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Begin troubleshooting with a simple check of the <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Pump/">fuel pump</a> electrical circuit. The pump should run while cranking the engine with the starter. If necessary, remove the floor cover and access plate in the luggage compartment and listen or feel to see whether the pump is running. If the pump does not run, <a href="626.html">Checking Electrical Circuit</a> <br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>CAUTION:</b>  In cold weather, water in the fuel may freeze in the pump, causing the circuit to overload and the fuse to fail. Be sure to check the fuse in position 18.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Pump/">fuel pump</a> runs, begin troubleshooting with a check of the fuel pump delivery rate. <a href="625.html">Checking Delivery Rate</a><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The test will indicate whether further tests are necessary. This is especially important on high-mileage cars, where normal pump wear may decrease delivery volume. Also check for correct pump installation and for a clogged pump screen.</div>
