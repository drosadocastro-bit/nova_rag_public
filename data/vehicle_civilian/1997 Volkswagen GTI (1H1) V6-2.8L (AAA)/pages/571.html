<h1>Readiness Code Generating (Generic Drive Cycle)</h1><b>Readiness Code Resetting Procedure (Generic Drive Cycle)</b><br><br><b>Readiness Monitors and Drive Cycles</b><br>"Readiness Monitors" are indicators that demonstrate whether or not emission system components are being monitored (checked) by the OBD-II system.  If a monitor is set to "Ready" the monitor is checking its assigned component and, if no DTC's are present, the vehicle should pass an emissions test.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b>  If the appropriate number of Readiness Monitors (codes) are not flagged as "Ready", in most cases, the vehicle can not pass an emissions test.  See State and Federal Laws.<br><br>The status of all readiness monitors is reset to <b>"Not Ready"</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Each time DTC's are cleared. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The battery is disconnected. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The ECM is disconnected. <br><br>The status of all readiness monitors is reset to <b>"Ready"</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>After DTC's are cleared and the appropriate drive cycle(s) is successfully completed. <br><br><h3>EPA Federal Test Procedure:</h3><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP66Q313/euro590/565336579.jpeg"></div><br><br><br>Manufacturers are required to validate monitors during the first 23 minutes (1372 seconds) of the Federal Test Procedure Drive Cycle. <br><br><h3>EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule:</h3><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP66Q313/euro590/565515921.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Completing the Drive Cycle successfully one (1) time should reset most drive cycle monitors to a "Ready" status.  However, there are "two trip" monitors, which require that the drive cycle be successfully completed two (2) times, to achieve a "Ready" status.  Furthermore, systems which use averaging, may require the drive cycle to be completed more than 2 times.<br><br>Verify the status of the readiness monitors with the appropriate function of your scan tool.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b>  Certain vehicles have known OBD-II Readiness issues.  Please be sure to review TSB's for special circumstances and or exceptions to readiness monitor resetting procedures.<br><br><b>Before Beginning the Drive Cycle</b><br>Check the status of the Readiness Monitors, check for DTC's, correct faults, clear DTC's before beginning the Drive Cycle.<br><br><b>Begin Drive Cycle</b> <br>The vehicle should be driven approximately 7.5 miles within a period of approx. 23 minutes (1372 seconds) from a cold start.  However, due to manufacture variations, it is necessary to perform only as much of the Drive Cycle as is necessary to reset the required monitors to a "Ready" status.  Operate the throttle smoothly to obtain best results.  <b>Do not shut the engine off</b> during the drive cycle.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>CAUTION:</b>  Obey all traffic laws and drive in a safe manner!<br> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b>  Extreme driving conditioning such as very high/low temperatures, rough roads and high altitudes may prevent some monitors from attaining a "Ready" status.<br><br>Step 1<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>(Engine Cold)</b> Start engine, idle 20 seconds.  Accelerate gradually and drive at 20-25 mph for 1 minute, varying speed.<br><br>Step 2<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Accelerate gradually to 32 mph within 35 seconds.  Decelerate to 0 mph in 10 seconds.  Idle for 40 seconds.<br><br>Step 3<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Accelerate at part throttle to 25 mph in 10 seconds.  Cruise at 17-25 mph for 15 seconds.  Accelerate gradually to 57 mph in 45 seconds.  Cruise at 50-56 mph for 1 minute.  Decelerate gradually to 0 mph in 40 seconds.  Idle for 15 seconds.<br><br>Step 4<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Accelerate at part throttle to 36 mph and maintain for 10 seconds.  Decelerate to 0 mph in 15 seconds.  Idle for 5 seconds.<br><br>Step 5<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Accelerate to 30 mph and back to 0 mph within 30 seconds.  Idle for 20 seconds.<br><br>Step 6<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Accelerate to 36 mph in 20 seconds.  Drive at 35 mph for 20 seconds.  Decelerate to 0 mph in 15 seconds.  Idle 5 seconds.<br><br>Step 7<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Accelerate gradually to 26 mph and decelerate to 0 within 40 seconds.  Idle 15 seconds.<br><br>Step 8<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Accelerate to 27 mph in 40 seconds.  Decelerate to 0 mph in 10 seconds.  Idle 25 seconds.<br><br>Step 9<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Accelerate to 26 mph in 15 seconds, maintain speed for 10 seconds, decelerate to 0 mph in 10 seconds.  Idle 15 seconds.<br><br>Step 10<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Accelerate to 23 mph in 20 seconds, decelerate to 0.5 mph in 10 seconds (no complete stop).  Accelerate to 28 mph and back to 0 mph (momentary stop 1 second) within 35 seconds.  <br><br>Step 11<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Accelerate gradually to 34 mph in 45 seconds.  Vary speed between 34 and 19 mph for 2 minutes.  Decelerate from 25 to 0 mph in 25 seconds.  Idle for 5 seconds.<br><br>Step 12<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Accelerate to 29 mph in 15 seconds, decelerate gradually to 0 mph in 45 seconds.  Idle for 30 seconds.<br><br>Step 13<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Accelerate gradually to 28 mph and back to 0 mph (momentary stop 1 second) within 50 seconds.  Accelerate gradually to 27 mph and back to 0 mph within 55 seconds.  Idle for 15 seconds.<br><br>Step 14<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Accelerate to 24 mph and back to 0 mph within 18 seconds.

Recheck the status of the "Readiness Monitors".<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b>  Remember, clearing DTC's or interrupting power to the ECM after the readiness monitors have been reset to <b>"Ready"</b> will require that the Drive Cycle be repeated.<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Completing the Drive Cycle successfully one (1) time should reset most drive cycle monitors to a "Ready" status.
