<h1>Refrigerant: Fundamentals and Basics</h1><b>Commercial Designation</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The following designations are used and appear on component labels and factory tags:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>R-134a<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tetrafluoroethane<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>CH2F CF3<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>H-FKW 134a<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>SUVA(R) TRANS A/C<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>ARCTON(R) 134a<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b>  R-134a <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> is packaged in different containers. One variation is SUVA(R) COLD MP, used only for commercial applications. This type of R-134a is sold in cylinders using a <b>1/4 inch</b> flare fitting, which will not connect to the <b>1/2 inch</b>-16ACME fittings used on the vehicle and servicing equipment. Use only R-134a which come in containers having the correct type of service fitting.<br><br><b>Color</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Refrigerant R-134a is colorless and is invisible as a gas. R-134a when viewed through the sight glass may appear milky due to the mixture of <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> and lubricating oil (PAG oil).<br><br><b>Temperature/Pressure Relationship</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Similar to R-12 <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a>, R-134a in an enclosed container will have a specific temperature/pressure relationship as follows:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Temperature in &deg;C (&deg;F) <span class='indent-30'>&#09;</span>Pressure in bar (psi)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-30 (-22) <span class='indent-31'>&#09;</span>0.0  (  0.0)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-20 ( -4) <span class='indent-31'>&#09;</span>0.3  (  4.4)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-10 ( 14) <span class='indent-31'>&#09;</span>1.0  ( 14.5)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>  0 ( 32) <span class='indent-31'>&#09;</span>1.9  ( 27.5)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span> 10 ( 50) <span class='indent-31'>&#09;</span>3.1  ( 45.0)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span> 20 ( 68) <span class='indent-31'>&#09;</span>4.7  ( 68.2)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span> 30 ( 86) <span class='indent-31'>&#09;</span>6.7  ( 97.2)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span> 40 (104) <span class='indent-31'>&#09;</span>9.1  (132.0)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span> 50 (122) <span class='indent-30'>&#09;</span>12.2  (177.0)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span> 60 (140) <span class='indent-30'>&#09;</span>15.8  (229.2)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span> 70 (158) <span class='indent-30'>&#09;</span>20.2  (293.0)<br><br><b><a href="175.html">Refrigerant Oil</a></b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A special Polyalkylene Glycol <b>(FAG)</b> synthetic oil is used in R-134a systems. This oil is NOT compatible with mineral based oils used in R-12 systems. <a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Service%20Precautions/">[1]</a><a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Testing%20and%20Inspection/">[2]</a><a>Service Precautions</a> for Warnings and Cautions regarding proper oil usage.<br><br><b>Airborne Properties</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Escaped <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> gases are heavier than air and will gather first in low places, such as underneath the car. R-134a refrigerant gas displaces oxygen and may cause suffocation in low areas of poor air circulation.<br><br><b>Effects on the Environment</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Because R-134a does not contain chlorine atoms, the major catalyst in ozone depletion, R-134a has no ozone depletion potential.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>R-134a does not cause smog and has a considerably lower global warming potential (greenhouse effect) than R-12 <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a>. Nonetheless, do not release R-134a into the environment and always recover/recycle using approved service equipment.<br><br><b>Effects on Plastics</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Refrigerant R-134a will deteriorate some plastics. When system temperature drops, these plastics can be deposited at the expansion valve or restrictor causing blockage. Therefore, when making system repairs, use only genuine VW replacement parts which are specified for use with the R-134a <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a>.<br><br><b>Effects on Metal</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>In its pure state, refrigerant R-134a is chemically stable and will not attack iron, copper, brass or aluminum. However, the mixture of R-134a and PAG oil may deteriorate certain metals (copper), which could lead to blockage, leaks or deposits on the compressor piston. Therefore, when making system repairs, use only genuine VW replacement parts that are specified for use with R-134a <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a>.<br><br><b>Water Solubility</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Liquid R-134a <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> will absorb only very minute quantities of moisture. However, R-134a vapor can absorb large amounts of moisture.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Water in the System Forms Ice in the Expansion Valve or Restrictor causing the system to stop cooling. In addition, moisture combines with the <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> to form acids which will damage the system.<br><br><b>Toxicity</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Refrigerant R-134a is non-toxic up to a temperature of <b>101 &deg;C (214 &deg;F)</b> and is safe when handled and used properly.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Above <b>101 &deg;C (214 &deg;F)</b>, gas pressure is above <b>39.5 bar (573 psi)</b> and R-134a begins to decompose into poisonous gases (hydrogen fluoride, carbonyl fluoride and fluorine). These gases give adequate warning of their presence since they cause irritation of the mucous membrane (throat).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Refrigerant R-134a gas has no effect on foodstuffs; it does not poison food or make it inedible.<br><br><b>Flammability</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>R-134a <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> is not flammable. In fact, it tends to inhibit combustion and has a fire extinguishing effect. However, a flame or glowing hot surface, as well as ultraviolet light (from electric welding), will decompose the refrigerant into poisonous gases (hydrogen fluoride, carbonyl fluoride and fluorine). These gases give adequate warning of their presence since they cause irritation of the mucous membrane (throat).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>R-134a can become flammable at pressures above ambient pressure in conjunction with air concentrations greater than 60% by volume.<br><br><b><a href="174.html">Refrigerant</a> Containers</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>DO NOT exceed maximum rated capacity of <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> containers. Never fill a container to more than <b>60 %</b> of its gross weight rating (for example, <b>18 lb</b> in a <b>30 lb</b> container).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Without sufficient room for expansion of R-134a (gas cushion), the container could explode when the temperature rises causing serious injury.<br><br><b>Leak Detection</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Use halogen leak detector Hitec HI400A-TEL or equivalent to check for R-134a system leaks. This tool can also be used to detect leaks in R-12 systems. Many currently available R-12 leak detectors cannot detect R-134a <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> leaks.<br><br><b>R-134a <a href="175.html">refrigerant oil</a></b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A special Polyalkylene Glycol <b>(PAG)</b> synthetic oil is used in R-134a systems. This oil is NOT compatible with mineral based oils used in R-12 systems.<br><br></div>
