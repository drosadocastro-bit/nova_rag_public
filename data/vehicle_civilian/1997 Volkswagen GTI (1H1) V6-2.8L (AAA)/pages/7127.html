<h1>Technician Safety Information</h1><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If you lack the skills, tools and equipment, or a suitable workshop for any procedure described in Alldata System, we suggest you leave such repairs to an authorized Volkswagen retailer or other qualified shop. We especially urge you to consult an authorized Volkswagen retailer before beginning repairs on any vehicle that may still be covered wholly or in part by any of the extensive warranties issued by Volkswagen.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Volkswagen is constantly improving its vehicles and sometimes these changes, both in parts and specifications, are made applicable to earlier models. Therefore, part numbers listed are for reference only. Always check with your authorized Volkswagen retailer parts department for the latest information.<br>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If you are going to work under a vehicle on the ground, make sure that the ground is level. Block the wheels to keep the vehicle from rolling. Disconnect the battery negative terminal (<a>ground strap</a>) to prevent others from starting the vehicle while you are under it.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Any time the battery has been disconnected on an automatic transmission vehicle, it will be necessary to reestablish Transmission Control Module <b>(TCM)</b> basic settings using the VAG 1551 Scan Tool <b>(ST)</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For vehicles equipped with an anti-theft radio, be sure of the correct radio activation code before disconnecting the battery or removing the radio. If the wrong code is entered when power is restored, the radio may lock up and become inoperable, even if the correct code is used in a later attempt.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Some of the vehicles covered by Alldata System are equipped with a supplemental restraint system <b>(SRS)</b>, that automatically deploys an airbag in the event of a frontal impact. The airbag is operated by an explosive device. Handled improperly or without adequate safeguards, it can be accidently activated and cause serious personal injury. To guard against personal injury or airbag system failure, only trained Volkswagen Service technicians should test, disassemble or service the airbag system.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Never use a test light to conduct electrical tests of the airbag system. The system must only be tested by trained Volkswagen Service technicians using the VAG 1551 Scan Tool (ST) or an approved equivalent. The airbag unit must never be electrically tested while it is not installed in the vehicle.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When driving or riding in an airbag-equipped vehicle, never hold test equipment in your hands or lap while the vehicle is in motion. Objects between you and the airbag can increase the risk of injury in an accident.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When boost-charging the battery, first remove the fuses for the Engine Control Module <b>(ECM)</b>, the Transmission Control Module (TCM), the ABS control module, and the trip computer. In cases where one or more of these components is not separately fused, disconnect the control module connector(s).<br></div>
