Keep an approved fire extinguisher handy.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Any time the battery has been disconnected on an automatic transmission vehicle, it will be necessary to reestablish Transmission Control Module (TCM) basic settings using the VAG 1551 Scan Tool (ST).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For vehicles equipped with an anti-theft radio, be sure of the correct radio activation cod,e before disconnecting the battery or removing the radio. If the wrong code is entered when power is restored, the radio may lock up and become inoperable, even if the correct code is used in a later attempt.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not re-use any fasteners that are worn or deformed in normal use. Some fasteners are designed to be used only once, and are unreliable and may fail if used a second time. This includes, but is not limited to, nuts, bolts, washers, circlips and cotter pins. Always follow the recommendations in this data, replace these fasteners with new parts where indicated, and any other time it is deemed necessary by inspection.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Keep sparks, lighted matches, and open flame away from the top of the battery.

Read all the instructions thoroughly, do not attempt shortcuts. Use tools that are appropriate to the work and use only replacement parts meeting Volkswagen specifications. Makeshift tools, pants and procedures will not make good repairs.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use pneumatic and electric tools only to loosen threaded parts and fasteners. Never use these tools to tighten fasteners, especially on light alloy parts.
