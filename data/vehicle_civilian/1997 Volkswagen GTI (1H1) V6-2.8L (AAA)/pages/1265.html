<h1>Charging Battery</h1><br><br><b>Battery charging</b><br><br><br><b>WARNING!</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- The battery plugs must be screwed in tightly when charging, measuring voltage or performing load tests.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Rooms in which batteries are charged must not be entered with an exposed lightiflame or while smoking, because during the battery charging process gasses are formed which are easily ignited.<br><br><br><b>Special tools and equipment</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Battery charging unit VAG 1471, VAG 1648, VAG 1974, Christie Automotive model 400 QDD or equivalent.<br><br><br><b>Notes:</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Battery must have minimum temperature of <b>50&deg; F (10&deg; C)</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Follow battery charger manufacturer's instructions.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Batteries must not be charged quickly; they are damaged when charging quickly.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- If heavily discharged batteries are charged quickly they accept no charge current; or are shown too early as fully charged by the so- called "surface charging." Afterward, they are not OK.<br><br><b>Battery charging</b><br><br>- Switch battery charging unit off.<br><br>- Switch ignition off.<br><br>- First disconnect battery Ground (GND) strap, and then positive cable from battery.<br><br>- Connect battery charging unit positive cable to battery positive terminal.<br><br>- Connect battery charging unit negative cable to battery negative terminal.<br><br>- Set battery unit charge current according to battery capacity.<br><br>- Switch battery charging unit on.<br><br><b>Procedures for totally discharged batteries</b><br><br><b>Remarks concerning totally discharged batteries</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Batteries that have not been used for a long time (e.g. vehicles that have been stored) self- discharge.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- A battery is totally discharged when the no load voltage has dropped below <b>11.6 V</b>. <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- On totally discharged batteries the electrolyte (sulfuric acid/water mixture) is almost all water the sulfuric acid part is heavily reduced.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Totally discharged batteries sulfate, causing the total plate surface of the battery to harden.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- If a totally discharged battery is charged again shortly after totally discharging the sulfation dissipates.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- If these batteries are not recharged the plates continue to harden and the ability to recharge is reduced. A reduction in the battery output is the result.<br><br>Totally discharged batteries must be charged with a small charging current as follows:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- The charge current must be set at a maximum of <b>10 %</b> of the battery capacity, therefore for a <b>60 Ah</b> battery the charge current is a maximum <b>6A (ampere)</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- See <b>Charging battery</b> above.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- The charge period must be at least <b>24 hours</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Totally discharged batteries must never be charged quickly.<br><br><br><b>Note:</b> After reconnecting battery:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Activate vehicle vehicle equipment such as radio, clock and power windows.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- On vehicles equipped with OBD II, activate readiness code.</div>
