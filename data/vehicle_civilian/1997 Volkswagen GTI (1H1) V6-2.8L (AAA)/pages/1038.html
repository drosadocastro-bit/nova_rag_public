<h1>Vehicle Damage Warnings</h1><br>Volkswagen is constantly improving its cars and sometimes these changes, both in parts and specifications, are made applicable to earlier models. Therefore, part numbers listed are for reference only. Always check with your authorized Volkswagen retailer parts department for the latest information.<br><br>Any time the battery has been disconnected it will be necessary to reestablish Basic Settings for the Engine Control Module <b>(ECM)</b> and, on vehicles with automatic transmission, the Transmission Control Module <b>(<a href="1091.html">TCM</a>)</b>, using the VAG 1551 Scan Tool <b>(ST)</b>.<br><br>On cars equipped with anti-theft radios, make sure you know the correct radio activation code before disconnecting the battery or removing the radio. If the wrong code is entered into the radio when power is restored, that radio may lock up and be rendered inoperable, even if the correct code is then entered.<br><br>Do not re-use any fasteners that are worn or deformed in normal use. Many fasteners are designed to be used only once and become unreliable and may fail when used a second time. This includes, but is not limited to, nuts, bolts, washers, self-locking nuts or bolts, circlips, cotter pins. Always follow recommendations given in this publication. Always replace these fasteners with new parts.<br><br>Before starting a job, make certain that you have all the necessary tools and parts on hand. Read all the instructions thoroughly, do not attempt shortcuts. Use tools appropriate to the work and use only replacement parts meeting Volkswagen specifications. Makeshift tools, parts and procedures will not make good repairs.<br><br>Use pneumatic and electric tools only to loosen threaded parts and fasteners. Never use these tools to tighten fasteners, especially on light alloy parts. Always use a torque wrench to tighten fasteners to the tightening torque listed.<br><br>Before doing any electrical welding on cars equipped with ABS, disconnect the battery Ground <b>(GND)</b> strap and the <b>ABS</b> Control Module connector.<br><br>When boost charging the battery, first remove the fuses for the Engine Control Module (ECM), Transmission Control Module (TCM), ABS Control Module, and the on-board computer. In cases where one or more of these components is not separately fused, disconnect the Control Module connector(s).<br><br>Do not quick-charge the battery (for boost starting) for longer than one minute, and do not exceed <b>16.5 volts</b> at the battery with the boosting cables attached. Wait at least one minute before boosting the battery a second time.<br><br></div>
