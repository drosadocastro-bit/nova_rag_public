<h1>Technician Safety Information</h1><br>Never work under a lifted car unless it is solidly supported on stands designed for the purpose. Do not support a car on cinder blocks, hollow tiles or other props that may crumble under continuous load. Never work under a car that is supported solely by a jack. Never work under the car while the engine is running. <br><br>If you are going to work under a car on the ground, make sure that the ground is level. Block the wheels to keep the car from rolling. Disconnect the battery Ground (GND) strap to prevent others from starting the car while you are under it.<br>Never run the engine unless the work area is well ventilated. Carbon monoxide kills.<br><br>Tie long hair behind your head. Do not wear a necktie, a scarf, loose clothing, or a necklace when you work near machine tools or running engines. If your hair, clothing, or jewelry were to get caught in the machinery, severe injury could result.<br><br>Illuminate the work area adequately but safely. Use a portable safety light for working inside or under the can Make sure the bulb is enclosed by a wire cage. The hot filament of an accidentally broken bulb can ignite spilled fuel or oil.<br><br>Finger rings should be removed so that they cannot cause electrical shorts, get caught in running machinery, or be crushed by heavy parts.<br><br>Disconnect the battery Ground (GND) strap whenever you work on the fuel system or the electrical system. Do not smoke or work near heaters or other fire hazards. Keep an approved fire extinguisher handy.<br><br>Do not attempt to work on your car if you do not feel well. You increase the danger of injury to yourself and others if you are tired, upset or have taken medicine or any other substance that may impair you from being fully alert.<br><br>Always observe good workshop practices. Wear goggles when you operate machine tools or work with battery acid. Gloves or other protective clothing should be worn whenever the job requires working with harmful substances.<br><br>Friction materials such as brake pads and <a href="969.html">clutch discs</a> may contain asbestos fibers. Do not create dust by grinding, sanding, or by cleaning with compressed air. Avoid breathing asbestos fibers and asbestos dust. Breathing asbestos can cause serious diseases such as asbestosis or cancer, and may result in death.<br><br>Catch draining fuel, oil or brake fluid in suitable containers. Do not use empty food or beverage containers that might mislead someone into drinking from them. Store flammable fluids away from fire hazards. Wipe up spills at once, but do not store the oily rags, which can ignite and burn spontaneously.<br><br>Keep sparks, lighted matches, and open flame away from the top of the battery. If escaping hydrogen gas is ignited, it will ignite gas trapped in the cells and cause the battery to explode.<br><br>The air-conditioning (A/C) system is filled with a chemical refrigerant that is hazardous. The A/C system should be serviced only by trained technicians using approved refrigerant recovery/recycling equipment, trained in related safety precautions, and familiar with regulations governing the discharging and disposal of automotive chemical refrigerants.<br><br>Do not expose any part of the A/C system to high temperatures such as open flame. Excessive heat will increase system pressure and may cause the system to burst.<br><br>Some vehicles covered are equipped with a supplemental restraint system (SRS), that automatically deploys an airbag in the event of a frontal impact. The airbag is operated by an explosive device. Handled improperly or without adequate safeguards, it can be accidently activated and cause serious personal injury. To guard against personal injury or airbag system failure, only trained Volkswagen Service technicians should test, disassemble or service the airbag system.<br><br>Never use a test light to conduct electrical tests on the airbag system. The system must only be tested by trained Volkswagen Service technicians using the Volkswagen VAG 1551 Scan Tool (ST) or an approved equivalent. The airbag unit must never be electrically tested while it is not installed in the car.<br><br></div>
