# HVAC SYSTEM MAINTENANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

## SECTION 1: SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**Residential HVAC Components**

A typical residential HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system consists of the following main components:

1. **Thermostat**: Control interface for temperature settings
2. **Air Handler**: Indoor unit containing blower motor and evaporator coil
3. **Condensing Unit**: Outdoor unit with compressor and condenser coil  
4. **Refrigerant Lines**: Copper pipes connecting indoor and outdoor units
5. **Ductwork**: Air distribution system throughout the building
6. **Air Filter**: Removes particulates from circulating air

**System Specifications**

- Refrigerant Type: R-410A (Puron) - environmentally friendly
- Cooling Capacity: 2-5 tons (24,000-60,000 BTU/hr)
- Heating Capacity: 40,000-120,000 BTU/hr (gas furnace)
- SEER Rating: 14-21 (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio)
- Operating Voltage: 240V AC for compressor, 24V AC for controls

**Refrigerant Cycle Overview**

The cooling cycle operates on vapor-compression principles:
1. Compressor pressurizes refrigerant gas (outdoor unit)
2. Hot gas flows to condenser coil, releases heat outdoors
3. Refrigerant condenses to high-pressure liquid
4. Liquid passes through expansion valve, pressure drops
5. Low-pressure liquid enters evaporator coil (indoor unit)
6. Liquid absorbs indoor heat, evaporates to gas
7. Cool gas returns to compressor, cycle repeats

## SECTION 2: ROUTINE MAINTENANCE

**Monthly Maintenance Tasks**

**Air Filter Replacement/Cleaning**

Frequency: Every 30 days (more often if pets or allergies present)

Procedure:
1. Locate filter slot (usually in return air grille or air handler)
2. Note airflow direction arrow on old filter
3. Remove old filter and inspect for dirt accumulation
4. Measure filter size (common: 16x20, 20x25, 16x25)
5. Install new filter with arrow pointing toward air handler
6. Ensure filter fits snugly in slot - gaps reduce efficiency
7. Mark installation date on filter frame

Filter Types:
- Fiberglass (MERV 1-4): Cheapest, minimal filtration
- Pleated (MERV 8-12): Good balance of cost and filtration
- HEPA (MERV 13-16): Best filtration, may restrict airflow
- Electrostatic: Washable, reusable, moderate efficiency

**Thermostat Battery Check**

If thermostat uses batteries:
1. Check display for low battery indicator
2. Replace batteries annually (typically 2x AA)
3. Preserve settings by replacing one battery at a time
4. Test system operation after replacement

**Seasonal Maintenance (Spring & Fall)**

**Outdoor Condenser Unit Cleaning**

Perform before cooling season (spring) and after (fall):

1. **Safety First:**
   - Turn off power at outdoor disconnect switch
   - Turn off circuit breaker at main panel
   - Verify power is off with voltage tester

2. **Remove Debris:**
   - Clear leaves, grass clippings, and debris from around unit
   - Maintain 2-foot clearance on all sides
   - Remove top grille/fan guard (usually 4 screws)
   - Remove large debris by hand

3. **Clean Condenser Fins:**
   - Spray fins from inside out with garden hose (low pressure)
   - Use commercial coil cleaner for heavy dirt:
     * Spray cleaner on fins per product directions
     * Let sit 5-10 minutes
     * Rinse thoroughly with water
   - Avoid pressure washer - damages fins
   - Straighten bent fins with fin comb

4. **Clean Fan Blades:**
   - Wipe fan blades with damp cloth
   - Remove any buildup on blade edges

5. **Reassemble and Test:**
   - Replace fan guard and secure with screws
   - Restore power at breaker and disconnect
   - Set thermostat to cooling mode
   - Verify unit starts and runs smoothly

**Indoor Evaporator Coil Inspection**

Perform annually (before cooling season):

1. **Access Coil:**
   - Turn off power to air handler
   - Remove access panel (usually sheet metal screws)
   - Locate evaporator coil (A-frame or slab configuration)

2. **Visual Inspection:**
   - Check for dirt buildup on coil fins
   - Look for signs of corrosion or refrigerant leaks
   - Inspect drain pan for standing water or rust

3. **Cleaning (if dirty):**
   - Spray no-rinse coil cleaner on coil surface
   - Let foam action work for 10-15 minutes
   - Wipe excess with soft brush if accessible
   - Do NOT use water - can damage electrical components

4. **Drain Pan Service:**
   - Remove standing water with wet vac
   - Clean pan with bleach solution (1 cup per gallon)
   - Check drain line for clogs

**Condensate Drain Line Maintenance**

Clogged drain lines cause water damage. Clean quarterly:

1. **Locate Drain Line:**
   - Usually 3/4" PVC pipe exiting air handler
   - Exits near outdoor unit or through foundation

2. **Clear Line:**
   - Pour 1 cup white vinegar into drain pan
   - Wait 30 minutes
   - Flush with 1 gallon water
   - Check for flow at outdoor exit point

3. **Severe Clogs:**
   - Attach wet/dry vac to outdoor exit point
   - Seal connection with duct tape
   - Run vac for 2-3 minutes to pull clog
   - Flush line after clearing

4. **Prevention:**
   - Install drain pan tablets (algae prevention)
   - Replace tablets every 3 months

## SECTION 4: ENERGY EFFICIENCY TIPS

**Optimizing System Performance**

1. **Programmable Thermostat:**
   - Set temperature back 7-10°F when away (8+ hours)
   - Saves 10% annually on cooling costs
   - Sample schedule:
     * Wake: 72°F (6:00 AM)
     * Leave: 78°F (8:00 AM)
     * Return: 72°F (5:00 PM)
     * Sleep: 75°F (10:00 PM)

2. **Optimal Temperature Settings:**
   - Summer: 78°F when home, 85°F when away
   - Winter: 68°F when home, 60°F when away
   - Each degree lower (summer) adds 3-5% to cooling costs

3. **Airflow Management:**
   - Keep all vents open (closing doesn't save energy)
   - Ensure furniture doesn't block return grilles
   - Keep interior doors open for proper circulation

4. **Duct Sealing:**
   - Seal duct joints with mastic (not duct tape)
   - Insulate ducts in unconditioned spaces
   - Typical duct leakage: 20-30% of airflow
   - Sealing saves 15-20% on HVAC costs

5. **Ceiling Fans:**
   - Run counterclockwise in summer (downdraft)
   - Allows 4°F higher thermostat setting
   - Turn off when room is unoccupied
