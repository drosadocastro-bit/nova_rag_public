<h1>Electrostatic Discharge</h1><b>ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Electronic components used in automotive computers are designed to operate at very low voltages <b>(3 to 5 VDC)</b>, and are extremely susceptible to damage caused by static electrical discharge. Voltages as low as <b>12 volts</b> can damage computer circuits. By comparison, it takes as much as <b>4,000 volts</b> of static discharge for a person to even feel the "ZAP", and there is no way of knowing whether the charge is positive or negative in nature.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>There are several ways in which a person can become statically charged. The most common methods of charging are by friction and induction. <br><br><b>CHARGING BY FRICTION</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Friction between organic materials (such as cotton or leather) and synthetics (such as plastic, vinyl, or glass) will generate static charges as great as <b>25,000 volts</b>. This can happen by simply sliding across a car seat or by wearing a cotton shirt under a coat made of synthetic materials.  <br><br><b>CHARGING BY INDUCTION</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Charging by induction occurs when a person standing near a highly charged object (strong magnetic field such as a transformer) momentarily touches ground. Like charges are displaced to ground, leaving the person highly charged with opposite polarity.  <br><br><b>PRECAUTIONS</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Static charges are gradually equalized by moisture in the air, but are retained much longer when humidity is low. Use care when handling and testing electronic components. <br><br><br><br><br></div>
