<h1>Environmental Impact Information</h1><b>Service Procedures</b> <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Because Alldata's information dates back to the early 1980s, service and repair procedures will at times instruct technicians to vent Freon into the atmosphere when opening the air conditioning refrigeration circuit. The Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990 requires that Freon be recovered when accessing the air conditioning circuit and that technicians hold a <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> recovery and handling certification. <br><br><b>The Ozone Layer</b> <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A thin layer of ozone molecules, located 10 to 30 miles above the earth, form a protective cover by absorbing a portion of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted from the Sun. <br><br><b>Ozone Depletion</b> <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Scientific research performed over the past 15 years links the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC)s, also know by the trade name Freon) into the atmosphere to ozone depletion. When CFC's are released into the atmosphere, they eventually reach the ozone layer located in the stratosphere where they react with and destroy ozone molecules.<br><br><b>Harmful Effects</b> <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ozone depletion and the corresponding increase in UV radiation has been shown to lead to higher incidents of cancer as well as global warming. When viewed from a global perspective, ozone depletion holds an enormous potential for damage. <br><br><b>Upper Level vs. Ground Level Ozone</b> <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Confusion often arises when we hear about the necessity of the ozone layer and ground level ozone. The ozone layer existing high above the earth is beneficial but the same compound, when located at ground level, is harmful to humans, animals, crops and vegetation.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ground level ozone is a component of smog and forms when hydrocarbons (HC) react with nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the presence of sunlight and heat. <br><br><b>Montreal Protocol</b> <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>In response to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the detrimental effects of (CFC)s, 24 countries and the European community met in Montreal, Canada, in 1987 to establish standards for the control of (CFC)s. Since that time, a total of 132 countries have become signatories to this agreement leading to an end of production of R12 in December, 1995, in all developed countries.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>As established by the Montreal Protocol, R12 production in developed countries has ceased. <br><br><b>Clean Air Act</b> <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The United States Congress, acting in response to the Montreal Protocol, banned production of (CFC)s by the year 2000. Congress also amended the Clean Air Act in an effort to control both the production and use of (CFC)s for <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> applications including mobile vehicle air conditioning systems.<br><br><b>Alternative Refrigerants</b> <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The introduction of alternative refrigerants, primarily the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) 134a, aims at preventing further ozone layer depletion. Because 134a is chlorine free, it is deemed ozone safe. <br><br><b>Technician Certification</b>                                                                                                                                                    <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Organizations providing technician <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> recovery and recycling certification include: <br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE)<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>13505 Dulles Technology Drive, Suite 2<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Herndon, VA  22071-3421<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Phone: (703) 713-3800<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fax: (703) 713-0727<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>http://www.asecert.org/<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>International Mobile Air Conditioning Association (IMACA)<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>P.O.
