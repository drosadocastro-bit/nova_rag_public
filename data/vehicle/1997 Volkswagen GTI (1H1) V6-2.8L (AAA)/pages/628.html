<h1>Operating Pump For Testing</h1><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The electric fuel pump operates only when the car is running or being started. Because many of the <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Pump/">fuel pump</a> and fuel injection tests require that the pump be operated with the engine off, the <a href="24.html">fuel pump relay</a> can be temporarily bypassed during testing.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP66Q313/euro590/516470927.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The procedure below uses a temporary wiring connection to bypass the <a href="24.html">fuel pump relay</a>. The preferred method is to use a remote switch, such as the VW special tool VAG 1348/3(3A), but you can accomplish the same thing with a homemade fused jumper wire and an in-line switch.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP66Q313/euro590/516472511.png"></div><br><br><br><b>OPERATING <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Pump/">FUEL PUMP</a> FOR TESTS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the <a href="24.html">fuel pump relay</a> from the fuse/relay panel.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>CAUTION:</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>A homemade jumper wire with a switch should be at least <b>1.5 mm</b> metric wire size (14 gauge-AWG) and, for safety, should include a 20 amp in-line fuse.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>To avoid damaging the relay sockets, the ends of the jumper wire should be flat-blade connectors that are the same size as the sockets in the relay panel.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Connect and disconnect the remote switch or jumper wire only with the switch in the off position.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Relay locations may vary.
