<h1>Technician Safety Information</h1>The subassemblies and lines at the air conditioner are filled with Tetrafluoroethane also known as refrigerant R-134a.<br><br>Refrigerant R-134a replaces the <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> R-12 which is reported to have harmful effects on the earth's ozone layer.<br><br>R-134a and R-12 systems are similar in design but there are very important differences in the <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a>, lubricating oils, service equipment and A/C system components.<br><br><b>WARNING:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Always use an Underwriter's Laboratory (UL) approved <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> recovery/recycling/recharging unit such as Kent-Moore ACA4, or equivalent, whenever discharging an R-134a A/C system.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>As of January 1, 1992 any person who services a motor vehicle air conditioner MUST; by law be properly trained and certified and use approve <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> recycling equipment Technicians must complete an EPA approved recycling course to be certified.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>State and local governments may have additional requirements regarding air conditioning servicing.

Exposure may irritate eyes, nose and throat.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Always wear hand and eye protection (gloves and goggles) when working around the A/C <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> system.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not expose any component of the A/C system to high temperatures (above 80 &deg;C/176 &deg;F) or open flames. Excessive heat will cause a pressure increase which could burst the system<br><br>WARNING:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Keep <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> containers stored below 5 &deg;C (12 &deg;F) and never drop from high places. DO NOT warm refrigerant containers with an open flame. If refrigerant needs to be warmed, place bottom of tank in warm water<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Keep <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> away from open flames because poisonous gas will be produced if it burns. Do not smoke when refrigerant gases are present for the same reason.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Electric welding near <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> hoses causes R-134a to decompose from ultraviolet light. Discharge System before electric welding.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pressurized R-134a <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> in the presence of oxygen may form a combustible mixture. Never introduce compressed air into any closed R-134a container (full or empty), A/C component or piece of service equipment.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DO NOT exceed maximum rated capacity of <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> containers. Never fill a container to more than 80 % of its gross weight rating (for example, 18 lb. in a 30 lb. container) Without sufficient room for expansion of R-134a (gas cushion), the container could explode when the temperature rises causing serious injury.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not steam clean condensers or evaporators. Use only cold water or compressed air.</b><br><br><b>CAUTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>R-12 and R-134a <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> are <b>NOT</b> compatible. Never add R-12 refrigerant to an R-134a system or R-134a refrigerant to an R-12 system. If the refrigerants are mixed, total system contamination will occur and compressor failure may result.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="175.html">Refrigerant oils</a> used for the R-134a system and R-12 system are <b>NOT</b> compatible. Use only the specified synthetic oil (Polyalkylene Glycol/PAG) for the R-134a <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> system. <b>DO NOT</b> use R-12 system oil in an R-134a system or R-134a system oil in an R-12 system. If the refrigerant oils are mixed, system contamination will occur and compressor failure may result<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>R134a <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> system oil (PAG oil) absorbs moisture very rapidly. Moisture combines with the refrigerant to form acids which will damage the system. Use only the specified oil from a sealed container and <b>ALWAYS</b> reseal oil container immediately after use. <b>DO NOT</b> use oil if it has become contaminated with moisture or if container has been left open.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Immediately plug open connections on A/C components to prevent dirt and moisture contamination. Likewise, <b>DO NOT</b> remove new component from packaging until ready to install. Immediately tighten component connections after installation.<br><br><b>CAUTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Always use separate <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> recovery/recycling/recharging servicing equipment for R-12 and R-134a systems. <b>DO NOT</b> use one piece of equipment for both R-12 and R-134a systems. The residual traces of refrigerant will contaminate and damage the equipment Servicing equipment includes recovery/ recycling(recharging unit, charging station, vacuum pump, manifold gauges, etc.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>DO NOT</b> use R-12 servicing equipment on R-134a systems or R-134a equipment on R-12 systems or damage to both the vehicle A/C system and servicing equipment may result. Use only equipment designed to meet Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standards.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>R-134a and R-12 systems use different size service fittings. <b>NEVER</b> use adaptors to convert an R-12 fitting to R-134a size or R-134a fitting to R-12 size,<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>R-134a and R-12 A/C components including compressor hoses, O-rings. evaporator condenser receiver-drier etc. are <b>NOT</b> interchangeable. Components of the R-134a system are identified by lettering R-134a or by a green label (or stripe). In addition, a label on the evaporator housing (below plenum tray) identifies which type of <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> is used. Use only the correct system component for each refrigerant type.<br><br><b>CAUTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Always replace damaged and/or leaking A/C system components. Do not attempt repair by soldering, brazing or welding.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Work area must be extremely clean when working on A/C system components.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use only tools, equipment and pans specified for use with R-134a.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Switch on existing exhaust/ventilation systems when working on the <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> system.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Discharge A/C system using <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> recovery/ recycling/recharging unit <b>Kent-Moore ACR4</b>, or equivalent before removing any A/C system component.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Always replace O-rings, <b>DO NOT</b> reuse. Use only the correct size and type of O-rings specified for use with R-134a <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a>. Lubricate O-ring with <a href="175.html">refrigerant oil</a> before installing.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Always reinstall cap(s) over A/C service valve(s).</div>
