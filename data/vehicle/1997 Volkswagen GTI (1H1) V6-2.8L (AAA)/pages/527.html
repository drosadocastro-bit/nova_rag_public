<h1>Checking the Basics</h1>All troubleshooting must begin by <b>"CHECKING THE BASICS"</b>. Certain basic faults can be undetectable by the self-diagnostic systems of the fuel and ignition control units, and in some cases can actually interfere with the self-checking and fault memory operation.<br><br>System fault codes are cleared whenever the <a>control unit</a> or the battery is disconnected. Therefore, all fault codes should be read prior to any vehicle power interruption or troubleshooting. <br><br>Prior to any teardown, repair or component replacement, the following steps should always be considered.<br><br><b>BATTERY STATE OF CHARGE</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Batteries in a state of partial discharge can have a dramatic effect on <a>control units</a> and related components.<br><br><b>POSITIVE BATTERY CABLE INTEGRITY</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>All B+ connections must be in perfect condition for trouble-free electronic system operation. The B+ side of the electrical system should be checked dynamically using the voltage drop technique.  <br><br><b>FUSE INTEGRITY</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fuses are employed to prevent possible damage to electrical components and wiring harnesses. The fuses and their connections must be without dynamic resistance. Dynamic resistance can only be checked using the voltage drop method of testing.  <br><br><b>NEGATIVE GROUND CONNECTIONS</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>As all electrical circuits are a circle, all B-connections must also be checked and verified to be in perfect condition. A poor "common" ground point will cause seemingly unrelated systems to influence one another. High current systems which encounter a poor "common" ground, can back feed through other electrical systems causing unusual operation and perhaps inexplicable component failure. As with the B+ side of the electrical system, the ground side should be checked dynamically using the voltage drop technique.<br><br><b>POWER TRAIN CABLE ATTACHMENTS</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Metal cables attached to the engine or transmission which appear overheated and/or discolored indicate the need to thoroughly test all ground connections. <br><br><b>POWER SUPPLY RELAYS</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The system relay as well as its' plug connection can be a source of intermittent operation which will not set a fault in <a>control unit</a> fault memory.<br><br><b>CRANKSHAFT POSITION/SPEED SENSOR</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Monolithic sensors should be checked statically and dynamically. Physical mounting and condition of the sensor must be assured.<br><br><b>HIGH TENSION COIL AND SECONDARY COMPONENTS WIRING</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The secondary <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Ignition%20System/">ignition system</a> should be checked visibly as well as with a suitable engine analyzer and scope. All components should be examined for tight connections and freedom from carbon tracking, moisture and corrosion.  <br><br><b>FUEL DELIVERY</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fuel delivery must begin at once when cranking and the pressure in the <a href="643.html">fuel rails</a> must be within specifications. <a href="460.html">Fuel pressure</a> retention must be maintained between the <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Pump/">fuel pump</a> outlet and the pressure regulator after engine shutdown. <br><br><b>SPARK PLUGS</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If out of specification, <a href="476.html">spark plugs</a> can significantly impair engine performance. Spark plug type, condition, and gap must verified according to specification.<br><br><b>AIR/FUEL RATIO</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When troubleshooting idle quality or driveability complaints, it is necessary to consider the following:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Injector spray pattern quality<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Presence of unmetered air leaks<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Evaporative purge system<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Excessive engine oil dilution<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Substandard fuel or unapproved additives<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Carbon build-up<br><br><br></div>
