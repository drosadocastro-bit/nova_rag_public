<h1>Technician Safety Information</h1><b>IMPORTANT</b>:<br>The contents of this information have been and will continue to be updated by Technical Bulletins. This has been updated to include information from Technical Bulletins available at the time of release that specifically cover changes or additions to repair procedures and specifications.<br><br>Technical Bulletins covering other important data, and those that have been created since the release of this information, are not included. Before using this information, be sure to look up the latest Technical Bulletins.<br><br>Please read these <b>WARNINGS</b> and <b>CAUTIONS</b> before proceeding with maintenance and repair work.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If you lack the skills, tools and equipment, or a suitable workshop for any procedure described in this data, we suggest you leave such repairs to an authorized Volkswagen retailer or other qualified shop. We especially urge you to consult an authorized Volkswagen retailer before beginning repairs on any vehicle that may still be covered wholly or in part by any of the extensive warranties issued by Volkswagen.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Never work under a lifted vehicle unless it is solidly supported on stands designed for the purpose. Do not support a vehicle on cinder blocks, hollow tiles or other props that may crumble under continuous load. Never work under a vehicle that is supported solely by a jack. Never work under the vehicle while the engine is running.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If you are going to work under a vehicle on the ground, make sure that the ground is level. Block the wheels to keep the vehicle from rolling. Disconnect the battery negative terminal (ground strap) to prevent others from starting the vehicle while you are under it.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Never run the engine unless the work area is well ventilated. Carbon monoxide (CO) kills.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tie long hair behind your head. Do not wear a necktie, a scarf, loose clothing, or a necklace when you work near machine tools or running engines. If your hair, clothing, or jewelry were to get caught in the machinery, severe injury could result.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Illuminate the work area adequately but safely. Use a portable safety light for working inside or under the vehicle. Make sure the bulb is enclosed by a wire cage. The hot filament of an accidentally broken bulb can ignite spilled fuel or oil.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Finger rings should be removed so that they cannot cause electrical shorts, get caught in running machinery, or be crushed by heavy parts.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not attempt to work on your vehicle if you do not feel well. You increase the danger of injury to yourself and others if you are tired, upset or have taken medicine or any other substance that may impair you or keep you from being fully alert.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Always observe good workshop practices. Wear goggles when you <br>operate machine tools or work with battery acid. Wear goggles, gloves and other protective clothing whenever the job requires working with harmful substances.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Friction materials such as brake pads and clutch discs may contain asbestos fibers. Do not create dust by grinding, sanding, or by cleaning with compressed air. Avoid breathing asbestos fibers and asbestos dust. Breathing asbestos can cause serious diseases such as asbestosis or cancer, and may result in death.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Catch draining fuel, oil or brake fluid in suitable containers. Do not use empty food or beverage containers that might mislead someone into drinking from them. Store flammable fluids away from fire hazards. Wipe up spills at once, but do not store the oily rags, which can ignite and burn spontaneously.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The air-conditioning (A/C) system is filled with a chemical refrigerant that is hazardous. The A/C system should be serviced only by trained automotive service technicians using approved refrigerant recovery/recycling equipment, trained in related safety precautions, and familiar with regulations governing the discharging and disposal of automotive chemical refrigerants.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not expose any part of the A/C system to high temperatures such as open flame. Excessive heat will increase system pressure and may cause the system to burst.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Some of the vehicles covered by this data are equipped with a supplemental restraint system (SRS), that automatically deploys an airbag in the event of a frontal impact. The airbag is operated by an explosive device. Handled improperly or without adequate safeguards, it can be accidently activated and cause serious personal injury. To guard against personal injury or airbag system failure, only trained Volkswagen Service technicians should test, disassemble or service the airbag system.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Never use a test light to conduct electrical tests of the airbag system. The system must only be tested by trained Volkswagen Service technicians using the VAG 1551 Scan Tool (ST) or an approved equivalent. The airbag unit must never be electrically tested while it is not installed in the vehicle.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When driving or riding in an airbag-equipped vehicle, never hold test equipment in your hands or lap while the vehicle is in motion. Objects between you and the airbag can increase the risk of injury in an accident.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Before starting a job, make certain that you have all the necessary tools and parts on hand. Read all the instructions thoroughly, do not attempt shortcuts. Use tools that are appropriate to the work and use only replacement parts meeting Volkswagen specifications. Makeshift tools, pants and procedures will not make good repairs.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Be mindful of the environment and ecology. Before you drain the crankcase, find out the proper way to dispose of the oil. Do not pour oil onto the ground, down a drain, or into a stream, pond, or lake. Consult local ordinances that govern the disposal of wastes.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Some aerosol tire inflators are highly flammable. Be extremely cautious when repairing a tire that may have been inflated using an aerosol tire inflator. Keep sparks, open flame or other sources of ignition away from the tire repair area. Inflate and deflate the tire at least four times before breaking the bead from the rim. Completely remove the tire from the rim before attempting any repair.</div>
