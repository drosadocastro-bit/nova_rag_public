<h1>Component Replacement Notes</h1>Replacement A/C compressors, evaporators and condensers supplied by the VW Parts Dept. are filled with Nitrogen. If gas (Nitrogen) does not escape when component is first opened, the component may be faulty (leaking), do not install.<br><br>Replacement A/C compressors are filled with the total <a href="175.html">refrigerant oil</a> (PAG oil) quantity needed for the entire <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> system.<br><br>Always replace the receiver drier whenever the <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> system has been opened. Install receiver drier immediately after opening to prevent moisture contamination of drier desiccant. Moreover, keep refrigerant system and other replacement components sealed for as long as possible to minimize the chance of dirt and moisture contamination.<br><br>Always plug open refrigerant line connections to prevent dirt and moisture contamination.<br><br>If the system has been discharged due to a damaged or leaking component (<a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> hose/line, compressor, evaporator, condenser, etc.), flush the refrigerant system first with compressed air, then with nitrogen (available locally) and collect the oil that runs Out. This will remove the <a href="175.html">refrigerant oil</a> which may be saturated with moisture.<br><br><b>CAUTION:</b>  DO NOT flash R-134a <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> system with R-11. R-11 is not compatible with R-134a refrigerant and PAG oil and will cause total system contamination.<br><br>After flushing the system, if the compressor is not replaced new, fill compressor with the correct type and quantity of <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> <b>(PAG)</b> oil as specified in Specifications. Fill compressor with the total system oil capacity.<br><br>If the compressor is replaced new, do not add any additional oil as the total amount of oil required is already in the compressor.<br><br>Dispose of contaminated <a href="174.html">refrigerant</a> (PAG) oil following laws governing hazardous waste disposal. Do not combine PAG oil with any other old oils such as engine oil or transmission fluid.<br><br>All A/C components specified for R-134a are identified with a green label or stripe. <br><br>Follow all applicable Warnings and Cautions when working on the R-134a A/C system. <a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Service%20Precautions/">[1]</a><a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Testing%20and%20Inspection/">[2]</a><a>Service Precautions</a></div>
