      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Explanation

The engine cranks but won't start, indicating a potential issue with the fuel system or ignition system.

To diagnose this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Verify Fuel Level**: Check the fuel gauge reading to ensure there is sufficient fuel in the tank.
2. **Check for Clogged Fuel Filter**: Inspect the fuel filter and replace it if necessary (service life: 15,000 miles).

If the fuel level is adequate and the fuel filter is clear, proceed with testing fuel pressure.

### Limitations

This response assumes a standard vehicle configuration and does not account for any modifications or customizations. If you are unsure about any aspect of the diagnosis or repair process, consult a qualified mechanic or refer to the vehicle's manufacturer documentation. 

### Safety Notice

Remember to work in a well-ventilated area, away from ignition sources, and follow proper safety procedures when working with fuel systems. Dispose of fuel-soaked rags properly. [Safety Notice 1-A]","When engine cranks but won't start, check these in order of likelihood: (1) Fuel system - verify fuel level and pump operation, test fuel pressure at 40-50 PSI [Citation: Para 1-2.1, Table 1-1]. (2) Ignition system - test for spark at plugs [Citation: Para 1-2.3]. (3) Air intake - inspect for severe restrictions [Citation: Para 1-2].

    ""user_input"": ""What's the correct torque specification for lug nuts?"",
    ""context"": ""vehicle_manual.txt""
  },
  ""response"": {

### Step-by-step reasoning:

The user asks about the correct torque specification for lug nuts. The context provided is a vehicle maintenance manual (vehicle_manual.txt). To answer this question accurately, we need to look up the relevant section of the manual.

In the manual, under ""Para 7-3: Brake System"" and specifically in ""Step 3: Rotate tires,"" it mentions that lug nuts should be tightened to ""85-95 ft-lbs in star pattern."" This information is found in Table 7-1, which lists torque specifications for various fasteners.

Therefore, the correct answer is that lug nuts should be tightened to 85-95 ft-lbs. The confidence level is high (1.0) because this information is directly extracted from the provided manual. The source of this information is clearly stated as ""Para 7-3.3, Table 7-1 in vehicle maintenance manual.""","Lug nuts should be torqued to 85-95 ft-lbs in a star pattern [Citation: Table 7-1, Para 7-3.3].",
