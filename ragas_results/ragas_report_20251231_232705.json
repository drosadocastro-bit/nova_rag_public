      "reference": "Code P0420 indicates 'Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold' - the catalytic converter is not operating at required efficiency [Citation: Para 6-2]. Possible causes: (1) Catalytic converter degradation (most common), (2) Oxygen sensor failure, (3) Exhaust leak before catalyst, (4) Engine running too rich [Citation: Para 6-2]. Verify by monitoring O2 sensor operation - downstream sensor should be steady around 0.45V; if it fluctuates like upstream sensor, converter has failed [Citation: Para 6-2.2].",
