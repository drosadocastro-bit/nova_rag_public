    ""message"": ""A high temperature gauge reading can indicate several potential issues with your vehicle's cooling system. Common causes include:\n\n1. **Low Coolant Level**: Check the coolant reservoir to ensure it is at the proper level.\n2. **Radiator Issues**: A clogged or damaged radiator can impede heat dissipation.\n3. **Water Pump Failure**: The water pump circulates coolant; if it's failing, overheating may occur.\n4. **Thermostat Malfunction**: If stuck closed, it prevents coolant flow and causes overheating.\n5. **Fan Problems**: A malfunctioning cooling fan can lead to inadequate air circulation over the radiator.\n\nIf you're unsure about diagnosing or fixing these issues, I recommend consulting a professional mechanic for a thorough inspection.""
