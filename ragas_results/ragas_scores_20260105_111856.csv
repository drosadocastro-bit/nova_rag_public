SECTION 6: DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODES
Para 6-1: OBD-II Code Overview
On-Board Diagnostics II (OBD-II) system monitors emissions and powertrain. When fault detected, system
stores code and may illuminate check engine light.
Code Format: P0XXX (Powertrain) or P1XXX (Manufacturer Specific)
Para 6-2: Code P0420 - Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold
Description: Catalytic converter not operating at required efficiency
Possible Causes:
1. Catalytic converter degradation (most common)
2. Oxygen sensor failure (upstream or downstream)
3. Exhaust leak before catalyst
4. Engine running too rich (other codes present)
Diagnostic Steps:
Step 1: Verify code is current
Clear codes with scan tool
Drive vehicle through complete drive cycle
If code returns, proceed with diagnosis [Citation: Para 6-2.1]
Step 2: Check oxygen sensor operation
Monitor O2 sensor voltages with scan tool
Upstream sensor: should fluctuate 0.1-0.9V rapidly

If voltage below 12.0V or fails load test, replace [Citation: Para 7-5.3]
APPENDIX A: SAFETY NOTICES
Safety Notice 1-A: Fuel System Hazards
Fuel is extremely flammable. Work in ventilated area. No smoking or open flames. Fuel under pressure - wear
eye protection. Dispose of fuel-soaked rags properly.
Safety Notice 2-A: Cooling System Burns
Cooling system operates under pressure. Opening hot system releases superheated coolant causing severe burns.
Wait minimum 30 minutes after engine shutdown. Never work on hot cooling system.
Safety Notice 3-A: Brake System Critical
Brake system failure causes loss of vehicle control. Only qualified technicians should perform brake repairs.
Use proper tools and follow exact procedures. Test brakes before returning vehicle to service.
Safety Notice 3-B: Low Brake Fluid Emergency
Low brake fluid indicates leak or worn pads. Do not drive vehicle. Investigate and repair immediately. Driving
with low fluid risks complete brake failure.
Safety Notice 3-C: Master Cylinder Failure
Failed master cylinder can cause complete brake loss. Do not attempt to drive vehicle. Tow to repair facility.
Brake failure can occur without warning.
Safety Notice 4-A: Overcharging Hazard
Voltage above 14.8V indicates regulator failure. Battery can overheat and explode. Turn off engine immediately.
Disconnect battery. Do not attempt to drive. Tow to repair facility.
Safety Notice 6-A: Carburetor Cleaner Flammable
Carburetor cleaner is extremely flammable. Use in ventilated area only. Keep away from ignition sources,
sparks, and flames. Avoid skin contact and breathing vapors.","Lug nuts should be torqued to 85-95 ft-lbs in a star pattern [Citation: Table 7-1, Para 7-3.3].",0.08640567986333653
