# Annex

This folder contains internal notes, logs, reviews, and templates kept for reproducibility and auditability. These documents are helpful for engineering traceability but are not required to understand or operate NIC.

## Contents
- Development logs (e.g., DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md)
- Cleanup and maintenance notes (e.g., CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md)
- Code review artifacts (e.g., CODE_REVIEW_REPORT.md, CODE_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md)
- Security tracking (e.g., SECURITY_FIXES_REQUIRED.md, SECURITY_FIXES_IMPLEMENTED.md)
- Validation and verification templates (e.g., VALIDATION_TEMPLATE.md, VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md)
- Optimization and tuning guides (e.g., OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md)

## Naming Guidance
Where possible, filenames aim to be neutral and descriptive. If you plan external review, prefer terms like:
- "Maintenance Log" over "Cleanup Summary"
- "Engineering Log" over "Development Journal"
- "Release Readiness Checklist" over "GitHub Release Ready"

We can rename or regroup specific files upon request; links in annex documents will be updated accordingly.
