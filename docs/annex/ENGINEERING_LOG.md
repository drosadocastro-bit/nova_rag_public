# Engineering Log

This journal documents engineering decisions, constraints, failures, and tradeoffs encountered while building a safety-first, offline RAG system intended for reproducible behavior rather than conversational fluency.

> Note: Entries below reference legacy LM Studio and the native llama-cpp path. The current stack runs on Ollama (http://127.0.0.1:11434) with `llama3.2:8b` and `qwen2.5-coder:14b`. Keep historical notes for context only.
