A failure can allow coolant to mix with the engine oil.\\n2. **Cracked Engine Block or Cylinder Head**: Physical damage or wear can create pathways for coolant to enter the oil passages.\\n3. **Blown Head Gasket**: Similar to head gasket failure, but specifically refers to a breach in the seal.\\n\\nImmediate action is required as this condition can lead to severe engine damage if not addressed promptly.
