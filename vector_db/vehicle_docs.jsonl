Work in ventilated area. No smoking or open flames. Fuel under pressure - wear\neye protection. Dispose of fuel-soaked rags properly.\nSafety Notice 2-A: Cooling System Burns\nCooling system operates under pressure. Opening hot system releases superheated coolant causing severe burns.\nWait minimum 30 minutes after engine shutdown. Never work on hot cooling system.\nSafety Notice 3-A: Brake System Critical\nBrake system failure causes loss of vehicle control. Only qualified technicians should perform brake repairs.\nUse proper tools and follow exact procedures. Test brakes before returning vehicle to service.\nSafety Notice 3-B: Low Brake Fluid Emergency\nLow brake fluid indicates leak or worn pads. Do not drive vehicle. Investigate and repair immediately. Driving\nwith low fluid risks complete brake failure.\nSafety Notice 3-C: Master Cylinder Failure\nFailed master cylinder can cause complete brake loss. Do not attempt to drive vehicle. Tow to repair facility.\nBrake failure can occur without warning.\nSafety Notice 4-A: Overcharging Hazard\nVoltage above 14.8V indicates regulator failure. Battery can overheat and explode. Turn off engine immediately.\nDisconnect battery. Do not attempt to drive. Tow to repair facility.\nSafety Notice 6-A: Carburetor Cleaner Flammable\nCarburetor cleaner is extremely flammable. Use in ventilated area only. Keep away from ignition sources,\nsparks, and flames. Avoid skin contact and breathing vapors.\nSafety Notice 7-A: Jack Stand Requirement\nNever work under vehicle supported by jack alone.
